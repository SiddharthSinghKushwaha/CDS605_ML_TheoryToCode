# CDS605_ML_TheoryToCode
This repository contains Python implementations of machine learning concepts taught in the CDS 605 PhD-level course. Each notebook translates theoretical examples discussed in class into practical, executable code.

## Key things to understand
> 1. Mathematical derivations Or background
> 2. Solving Numberical Examples (For better understanding)
> 3. Implemention in programming language like Python (Practical Understanding)
