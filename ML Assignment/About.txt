This assignment is not for grades. This is for practice. It consists of the following sections:

Section A: Numpy 
    A total of 21 questions are given.

Section B: Pandas
    A total of 10 questions are given.

Section C: Matplotlib
    A total of 10 questions are given.

Section D: Scikit-learn
    Instructions
        1. Implement the specified algorithm and interpret the algorithm
        2. Possible source of datasets from the UCI repository or Kaggle

  The following algorithms need to be implemented
  1. Linear regression
  2. Logistic regression
  3. K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
  4. Naive Bayes Classification
  5. Decision Trees for Classification
  6. Random Forest for Feature Importance
  7. Feature Selection: Wrapper method
  8. Feature Selection: Filter Method
  9. Clustering: K-means, GMM, Hierarchical

Additional instructions are also written for implementing the above algorithms. 

Self-Declaration: I will not use any AI assistance for solving any of these questions. These are for learning, not to impress others.
